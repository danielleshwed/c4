  <h2>Flaws in Documentation</h2>
  <p>There is little to no comments in the code. There is 3 files, an index.html file, a script.js file
    and a style.css file. The script.js file holds all the functionality of the program and requires the most
    documentation and commenting. There are comments throughout the code which are commented out pieces of code
    that are not needed in the program anymore. These should be deleted. Also some comments are not worded well
    and do not provide much value. These comments need to be reworded in order to be valuable to the reader. </p>
